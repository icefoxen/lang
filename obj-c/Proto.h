/* Proto.h
 * A prototype protocol.  Hehehe.
 * A protocol is just like a Java interface; any class can use it, and it just
 * specifies some methods they have to implement.
 *
 * Aaaand, it doesn't look like this compiler supports protocols either; even
 * though it appears to recognize the @protocol decleration, it doesn't
 * recognize anything after it.
