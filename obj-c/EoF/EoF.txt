EDGE OF INFINITY

INSPIRATIONS:
Timewarp
Inner Space
Tyrian


OVERALL:
Starfield --multilayered?  Check out Timewarp...

No limits to speed, no relativity.  Leave in the number wrap-around, it'll be
a bit more surreal... though I'll be really impressed if you can wrap around a
32-bit float.

Do collisions do damage?  Only some collisions?  Timewarp vs Inner Space.

Resources?


SHIP:
Called the Shattered Water.  Look at Timewarp and/or Tyrian for picture ideas.
Tau, baby.

1 beamer, 1 missile-rack, 2 specials

Single and dual beamer, torpedo launcher, flamers, shields, boosters, tractors
and grapples, claws, drones, scouts, interceptors, sidekicks, mags, pusher
missiles (Tau storm).  Short-range warps (Tau hunter).  Missile swarms,
missile lock, targeting beacons, gunner platforms, starclusters, streamer
missiles, Lightning!, beamlance, Noble Weapons!  Blinder missiles, reflectors,
Harbenger missiles.  Tracers!  Beamholms!

Auto-repair

Limited fuel and ammo?  Limited recharge a la TW.  

Nebula and gas-giant scoops!

Upgrades?  Sensors, shields, targeters, etc.

Drones, rear turrets...


PEOPLE:
Friends?  Sidekicks.  Explorers, raiders, corsairs, corperations, traders, privateers.  Teams.  Police.  Denizens!

Rescue service, like Inner Space hospital.  

Juno and Lynn, heh.  Medusa Kestrel.


SPACE:
Top-down view.
Web-patterns.  Shifting fractals.  Planets, stations, asteroids, platforms,
islands, nebulae.  Color-streaks.  Trees, graphs.  Speed-gates.  Teleporters.
Bouncers, pinball flippers, spiral screws, gear-crushers.  Ghosts.  Complexes,
caves, stars, volcanos, gravity-wells, black holes, novae, star-crushers and
eaters.  Atomos!  Carbunkle, Ramuh, lava-lamps, angels, magma chambers.
Transmats.  Madness Machines.  Amoebae, airships, tunnelers, pillows,
popsicles, TEA!, punch and nibbles...  Straightline warp, circle-vortices,
webspinners.  Hazard blocks, fireworks.
Fog --semitransparent layer??
Certain things /drift/.
Switches an' things that break walls, a la Sonic the Hedgehog.
