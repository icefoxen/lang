Languages worth using, that I don't enough:
Common Lisp (especially CLOS)
Objective C
Rexx
Forth
Icon
Io
D
Dylan
Erlang

...the fact that there are so many of them tells you something about why I
don't use them.  If I were to rate them in order of how much I wished I used
them, then you might get this:
Common Lisp
Erlang
Ruby
Rexx
Dylan
