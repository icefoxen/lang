% These chars are special: &$#%_{}^~\ 

\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
% Input file MUST have these two lines, plus \end{document} at the end.
% No spaces in the {} are allowed!

\section{Simple Text}  % Makes a section title.
Words are seperated by one or more space.  Paragraphs are seperated by
one or more blank lines.

The output is not affected by extra spaces or blank lines.

Double quotes are typed like this: ``Quoted text''.
Single quotes like this: `single-quoted text'.
Long dashes are typed as three dash chars ---like this.
Emphasized text is typed like this: \emph{this is emphasized}.
Bold text is typed like this: \textbf{this is bold}.

\subsection{A Warning or Two}  % This makes a subsection title.
If you get too much space after a mid-sentence period ---abbreviations
like etc.\ are the common culprits--- then type a backslash followed by a 
space after the period, as in this sentence.

Remember, don't type the 10 special characters except as directed!  The 
following seven are printed escaped by a backslash: 
\$ \& \# \% \_ \{ and \}.

The manual tells you how to make other symbols.

\end{document}  % ends input file.
