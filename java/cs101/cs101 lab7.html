<H3>Part I. Practice Exercises:</H3>
Expect exercises like these on the quiz.
You will benefit most by doing the exercises before you
<A HREF="solutions.html">look at the solutions</A> or attend
the help session on Wednesday Oct. 17
when they will be discussed.
<P>

<b>Directions:</b>
Consider Java's built in <A href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~kjg/jdk1.2.1/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html">LinkedList</A>
class, which is an implementation of a list abstraction
similar to the one presented in lecture.
Note that the value contained in
each list item in a LinkedList is simply an Object reference, so
when we get the data out using any of the accessors or an iterator,
an Object reference is returned.  Therefore, it is often
necessary to <b>cast</b> to the appropriate type before calling a method
on the object itself.  (This can result in a ClassCastException
when the actual object's type doesn't match the type of the cast.)
<P>
Primitives like <tt>int</tt> and <tt>double</tt> are not classes,
so their values are not Objects.  However, sometimes we want to be able
to put a primitive value in a data structure where an Object is required.
Therefore, as a convenience, Java provides classes that correspond to
each of the primitive types.  For example, the <tt>Integer</tt> class provides
a constructor whose parameter is the <tt>int</tt> value that should be
held inside the object, and provides an accessor <tt>intValue</tt> that
returns the <tt>int</tt> value that was stored in the <tt>Integer</tt> object.

<OL>

<P><LI>Study the following procedures and then write
specifications of what they do.  If in doubt, try hand simulating the
execution of the procedure on some small test cases.  In these
exercises, assume that all of the casts are legal.
<P>

<PRE>
LinkedList foo(int n) {
  LinkedList result = new LinkedList();
  while (n >= 0) {
     result.addFirst(new Integer(n));
     n--;
  }
  return result;
}


double bar(LinkedList numbers) { // numbers is not null
  Iterator it = numbers.iterator();
  double result = 0;
  while (it.hasNext())
    result += Math.pow(((Integer) it.next()).intValue(), 0.5);
  return result;
}


LinkedList baz(LinkedList a, LinkedList b) { // a and b are not null
  Iterator ls1 = a.iterator();
  Iterator ls2 = b.iterator();
  LinkedList result = new LinkedList();
  while (ls1.hasNext() && ls2.hasNext()) {
    String aString = (String) ls1.next();
    String bString = (String) ls2.next();
    result.addLast(aString + " " + bString);
  }
  return result;
}
</PRE>

<LI> Write a procedure <TT>pairwiseSum</TT> that takes as its parameters
two LinkedList objects and returns a new LinkedList that is
the pairwise sum of the list.
You may assume that all objects in both lists are of type Integer.
The objects in the resulting list should be Integer as well. If the lists
are of different lengths, do the computation as if
the shorter list has zeros at the end.  For example, if the given
lists are (1 2 3 4) and (4 5), the resulting list would be (5 7 3 4).
<P>

<LI> Write a procedure <TT>reverse</TT> that takes as its parameter
a LinkedList and returns a new LinkedList with
the same data, but in the reverse order.
<P>

<LI> Write a procedure <TT>multiplyPosition</TT> that takes as its parameter
a LinkedList containing Double objects as data, and returns another
LinkedList in which each of the original values was multiplied by its
position (index) in the list.  For example, if the input was (2 2 2 1 9),
the result would be (0 2 4 3 36), computed as follows: (2*0 2*1 2*2 1*3 9*4).
</OL>

<H3>Part II. A Polynomial ADT</H3>

In this lab, you will write a program that creates, manipulates, and
evaluates polynomials of arbitrary degree.  You will begin by creating
a Polynomial class that, among other things, is capable of evaluating
itself at points along the x axis.  Then you will create a
ListOfPoints class that you will use
to keep track of a list of points along the curve of the polynomial.
If you do the extra credit part, you'll use the ListOfPoints to help
you graph polynomials on the screen.
<P>

Note: In the text of the lab, and in the output you generate, we'll use
the caret (^) symbol to denote exponentiation.  However, you should
keep in maind that this is <b>not</b> Java
syntax.  (In fact, you may recall that the symbol is used for the
boolean operator xor in Java.)
<P>

<OL>
<LI>There are no provided files for this lab.
Create a new Eclipse project called Lab7.
In the project, create a class called Lab7.java and create a "main" method
in that file to use as the starting point for your program.
(You can look at one of the earlier projects for an example.)

<P><LI>In a new file called <B>Polynomial.java</B>, define a class
called <code>Polynomial</code> that satisfies
the following specification.
Your Polynomial class will be
a "wrapper" that uses a LinkedList as its
internal representation.
Be sure to test thoroughly and provide your test cases when
you turn in the assignment.
<!--
The CS101Canvas provided with this assignment has
a method <tt>showData</tt> that draws box-and-arrow diagrams
for data structures.   Using this feature may help you
understand the data structures better.
For each Polynomial instance,
you'll see the ListOfObjects, its head and tail list items, and
the list items for each coefficient with references to their
data values.
Since each Polynomial involves so many objects, small examples will be
easier to understand.  Moving the objects around on the screen
may help.
Also, well-placed "sleep" calls in your program
can be used to slow things down so you can see the data structures
change as the program runs. 
-->
<P>

<OL>
<LI>The constructor creates a polynomial with no terms.

<P><LI>The method <code>toString</code> takes no parameters and
returns a String representation of the polynomial.  For example,
you might return something like
"4 + -7x + 0x^2 + 11x^3" as the result.

(Note: If you want to be more clever about <code>toString</code>, you can
watch the signs and omit terms with a zero coefficient, returning
something like  "4 - 7x + 11x^3" instead.  Still better, show the high-order
terms first, as in "11x^3 - 7x + 4".)

<P><LI>The method <code>addTerm</code>
takes a double as its parameter and creates
a new high-order term of the polynomial with that coefficient.
For convenience, let
your method return "this" so you can make subsequent calls on the same
line.  For example,
<PRE>
Polynomial foo = new Polynomial();
foo.addTerm(4).addTerm(-7).addTerm(0).addTerm(11);
</PRE>
could be used as a shorthand for
<PRE>
Polynomial foo = new Polynomial();
foo.addTerm(4);
foo.addTerm(-7);
foo.addTerm(0);
foo.addTerm(11);
</PRE>
to create the polynomial 4 + -7x + 0x^2 + 11x^3.


<P><LI>The method <code>evaluate</code> takes a double value <em>x</em> as its
parameter, and returns the double value of the polynomial at point <em>x</em>.
For example, if the polynomial is
7 + 5x - 2x^2 + 5x^3, then <code>evaluate(2.0)</code> would return 49.0.
Use a recursive implementation of
<A href="../../Notes/DataStructures/structures.html#horner">Horner's method</A>
as the algorithm for evaluation.
For example,
<P>
<center> 7 + 5x - 2x^2 + 5x^3 = 7 + x(5 + x(-2 + x(5))). </center>
<P>
(Hint: Pass an iterator as one parameter to
a recursive helper procedure.)

<P><LI>The method <code>derivative</code> takes no parameters and
returns a <B>new</B> Polynomial that is the first derivative of this
polynomial.  For example, if this polynomial is 7 + 5x - 2x^2 + 5x^3,
you would return a Polynomial object 
representing the polynomial 5 - 4x + 15x^2.

<P><LI>The method
<code>sum</code> takes another Polynomial as its parameter and returns
a <B>new</B> Polynomial that is the result of adding together the two
polynomials.  It should return the correct result
even if the two polynomials are of different degree.


<!--
<P><LI><b>(Extra credit)</b> The method <code>product</code> takes
another Polynomial as its parameter and returns a new Polynomial that
is the result of multiplying the two polynomials. 
This is very tricky!  Attempt this only after you have
completed the rest of the lab.
-->
</OL>

<P><LI>In a new file called <B>ListOfPoints.java</B>, define a class called
<code>ListOfPoints</code> that
holds a list of <A href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~kjg/jdk1.2.1/docs/api/java/awt/Point.html">Point</a> objects according to
the following specification.  Again, use a LinkedList for your
internal representation.
<B>Be sure to test all methods thoroughly.</B><P>
<P>

<OL>
<LI>The ListOfPoints constructor takes no parameters and creates an empty list of points.

<P><LI>The method <code>toString</code> takes no parameters returns a String
representation of the list of points.  For example, you might return
something like "( (0,4) (25,0) (50,8) )" as your result. 

<P><LI>The method <code>isEmpty</code> returns <code>true</code>
if and only if the list contains no points.

<P><LI>The method <code>append</code> takes a Point as its parameter
and inserts the point at the end of the list.

<P><LI>The method <code>listIterator</code> returns an Iterator for
the list of points.

<P><LI>The method <code>minX</code> returns the least value of x in the
list.

<P><LI>The method <code>maxX</code> returns the greatest value of x in the
list. 

<P><LI>The method <code>minY</code> returns the least value of y in the
list. 

<P><LI>The method <code>maxY</code> returns the greatest value of y in the
list.

<!--
<P><LI>The method <code>clip</code> takes four integers <code>(minX,
minY, maxX, maxY)</code> and returns a <b>new</b> ListOfPoints that
contains only those points in this list that fall within the rectangle
defined by the given parameters.
-->

<P><LI>The method <code>rescale</code> takes four doubles <code>(x1,
y1, width, height)</code>.
The method should not modify the existing list, but instead
should create and return a <b>new</b>
ListOfPoints that results from rescaling all of the points in this
list so that they fit exactly within
the rectangle defined by the parameters to the method.
(If you do the extra-credit graphing option,
you will use this method to rescale the points to "fit" the size of
the canvas for graphing.)  Create new rescaled points.
Don't modify the original points.
<P>
Hint: To find the x coordinates in the new list,
first subtract minX from the x value in the old list,
then multiply by the ratio (width / (maxX - minX)), and finally
add x1.
Treat each y coordinate similarly.
For example, suppose the list is
<center>( (3,8) (4,5) (5,11) ).</center>
Then <code>rescale(0.0, 0.0, 50.0, 8.0)</code> would return the list
<center>( (0,4) (25,0) (50,8) ).</center>
What will happen in your implementation of this method
if the minimum and maximum x are equal?

</OL>

<P><LI>Now, go back to your Polynomial class, and create a method
called <code>sample</code> that takes three double parameters
<code>(xlow, xhigh, interval)</code> and returns a ListOfPoints that
results from evaluating the polynomial in the range between
xlow and xhigh with the given interval.  For example, if the polynomial
is x^2 + 2x - 3, then <code>sample(-4, 4, 2)</code> would return the list
( (-4,5) (-2,-3) (0,-3) (2,5) (4,21) ).
Test this thoroughly.


<P><LI>Finally, put it all together.  In your file <b>Lab7.java</b>,
modify the <code>main</code> method to
create several different Polynomial objects with different coefficients.
For each polynomial, 
<OL>
<LI> Print both the polynomial
and its derivative to the terminal.
<LI> Sample the polynomial at approximately 10 different x values,
evenly spaced in an interesting region of the curve,
creating a ListOfPoints.  (For example, if the polynomial
is 2x^2 + 3, then it is "interesting" around the y-axis, so you
might sample points in the range x=-5 to x=5 with an
interval of 1.)
<LI> Print the resulting ListOfPoints to the terminal. <B>Use a
calculator to verify that the results are correct.</B>
<LI>Rescale the points in the rectangle (25,50,200,100), and print out
the resulting rescaled list of points to the terminal.  Again, verify
that the numbers are right.
</OL>
</OL>

<B>Implementation Notes: </B>
So the compiler finds the LinkedList class and the
Iterator interface, be sure that
the line <TT>import java.util.*;</TT> appears near the top of the files
that use them.
Similarly,
to use Java's Point class, be sure that
the line <TT>import java.awt.*;</TT> appears near the top of the file.
If you want to allow non-integer coordinates, you can use the
<A href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~kjg/jdk1.2.1/docs/api/java/awt/geom/Point2D.Double.html">Point2D.Double class</a> instead of the Point class, in which case you will need to
<TT>import java.awt.geom.*</TT> in each file that uses it.
<P>

<P><HR><P>

<B>Extra credit option:</B>
(2 points)
The extra credit option for this assignment is to graph each of your
polynomials on a CS101Canvas, as follows.  Items 1-4 must be
entirely implemented in order for any extra credit to be awarded.
(If you are working with a lab partner, the "extra credit" option is
required for full credit on the assignment.)
To use the canvas, you can import it from one of your earlier projects.

<OL>
<P><LI>In the ListOfPoints class, add a method <tt>getShape</tt>
that takes no parameters and returns a 
<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~kjg/jdk1.2.1/docs/api/java/awt/geom/GeneralPath.html">GeneralPath</a> whose shape is defined by the points in the list.
That is, your shape will have a line from the first point to the second, a
line from the second to the third, and so on.
After calling the GeneralPath constructor,
call the methods <b>moveTo</b> and <b>lineTo</b> to create
the shape of the curve.

<P><LI>For each ListOfPoints you create in your test program, rescale the
points to fit on a CS101Canvas, call the getShape method on the rescaled
ListOfPoints, and display the shape on the canvas.  

<P><LI>
Recall that
in computer graphics, the coordinate (0,0) is at
the upper left, and y increases down the screen.
Therefore, after you rescale the points, you'll need to
"flip over" the graph so that it doesn't look upside down to a
mathemetician.  Write a separate method in ListOfPoints to flip over
the points.  In your test cases, be sure to print out the flipped over
points and verify that they are correct.

<P><LI>Show the x and y axis on your graphs, with
appropriate labels and tick marks.
(If the the origin (0,0) is not part of the region that you are graphing,
you can show the two axes as perpendicular non-intersecting line segments.)
