</p><h3>Part I. Practice Exercises</h3>
Expect questions like these on the quiz.
You will benefit most by doing the exercises before you
<a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/%7Ekjg/cs101/Labs/lab6/solutions.html">look at the solutions</a>
or attend the help session.
<p>

<b>Directions:</b>
Consider the following class definition (as presented in lecture) and
then answer the questions below.

</p><pre>class ListItem {
   public int number;
   public ListItem next;

   ListItem(int number, ListItem next) {
      this.number = number;
      this.next = next;
   }

   public String toString() {
      if (next == null)
         return "" + number;
      else
         return number + " " + next;
   }
}
</pre>

<ol>
<p></p><li> Carefully draw an object and reference diagram corresponding to
the result of executing the following code.
<b>If an object is "shared" by two or more lists, draw it only once
with multiple arrows pointing to it.</b>
Remember that Java evaluates expressions left to right, but always
evaluates parameters before making a procedure call.
 
<pre>
ListItem a, b, c, d;
a = new ListItem(1,null);
b = new ListItem(2,null);
b.next = a;
c = new ListItem(3,b);
d = new ListItem(4, new ListItem(5, new ListItem(6, b)));
c = c.next;

Terminal.println("a = (" + a + ")");
Terminal.println("b = (" + b + ")");
Terminal.println("c = (" + c + ")");
Terminal.println("d = (" + d + ")");

</pre>

<p></p></li><li>What output would be printed as the result of executing the
code given in Problem 1?

<p></p></li><li>A ListItem object (as defined above) is stored in memory as two
contiguous memory cells (contiguous means that they are consecutive,
one immediately following the other).
The first cell of the object corresponds to the number being held by the
ListItem, and the second cell contains the memory address of the next
ListItem.  Draw an object and reference diagram for ListItems being
held in the following memory.  There are two lists, one starting
at memory location 112, and the other starting at memory location 104.
In memory, the null value is represented as 0. 
<p>

<small>
</small><table border="1">
<tbody><tr><th>Memory Address</th><th>Memory Contents</th></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>107</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>102</td><td>112</td></tr>
<tr><td>103</td><td>116</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>134</td></tr>
<tr><td>105</td><td>118</td></tr>
<tr><td>106</td><td>109</td></tr>
<tr><td>107</td><td>100</td></tr>
<tr><td>108</td><td>103</td></tr>
<tr><td>109</td><td>114</td></tr>
<tr><td>110</td><td>116</td></tr>
<tr><td>111</td><td>106</td></tr>
<tr><td>112</td><td>111</td></tr>
<tr><td>113</td><td>102</td></tr>
<tr><td>114</td><td>116</td></tr>
<tr><td>115</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>116</td><td>122</td></tr>
<tr><td>117</td><td>114</td></tr>
<tr><td>118</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>119</td><td>110</td></tr>
</tbody></table>


</p><p></p></li><li>In problem 3, which memory locations are not used
in either list?

<p></p></li><li>Suppose we store the value 118 into memory location 117.
Now what would the object and reference diagram look like?
Now which memory locations are not used in either list? 

<p></p></li><li>Assuming that memory locations are allocated in order starting
from address 200, draw a memory table like the one in Problem 3
that would result at the end of the execution of the code in Problem
1.  Which memory locations are not used in any of the lists?

</p><h3>Part II. Linked List Manipulation</h3>

In this lab, you will be working with list structures.
Download 
<a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/%7Ekjg/cs101/Labs/lab6/lab6.zip">lab6.zip</a> and import it into a new Eclipse project.
In some parts of this lab, you'll
be asked to write <b>new methods for the ListItem class</b>.  Those
will go in the provided file ListItem.java.  In other parts of the lab, you'll
be asked to write procedures that <b>create and use ListItem
objects</b>, but are not methods of the ListItem class.  Those
procedures, as well as all of your tests, belong in the file
Lab6.java. Be sure to test all of them thoroughly.
<p>

<b>Seeing your data structures on the canvas:</b> The CS101Canvas
provided with this assignment has a method <tt>showData</tt> that
draws box-and-arrow diagrams for data structures.  A reference to any
object can be passed as a parameter to the <tt>showData</tt> method.
For example, if you pass a ListItem, you'll see the its number and its
reference to the next item, which in turn will contain a number and a
next, and so on.  (For long lists, the layout may not be the best, but
dragging the objects around with the mouse may help.)

</p><p>
In this lab, the ListItem constructor is written to show
every ListItem on the canvas.  If the ListItem changes later,
the display will update accordingly.
Well-placed "sleep" calls in your program can be used to
slow things down so you can see the data structures change as they are
being built or modified.
(Note that <tt>showData</tt> will only show
the values of the public instance variables.  It does not show private
instance variables, and it does not show local variables.)
If the canvas becomes cluttered with too many different lists,
you may want to create a fresh canvas on at different points in your
test program.  To do this, call
the method ListItem.startNewDisplay().
</p><ol>

<li>In the file <b>ListItem.java</b>, write methods for the ListItem
class that satisfy the following specifications.  <b>Test each
thoroughly.</b>
In each case, be sure to use recursion or iteration as specified.
Where not indicated, you may choose either approach.
<p>

</p><ol>
<li>A <b>recursive</b> method <code>length</code>
that takes no parameters and returns the number of elements in the list.
For example, the list (3 5 9 3 2 4) would have length 6.
<p>

</p></li><li>A <b>recursive</b> method <code>duplicate</code>
that takes no parameters and returns a new ListItem that begins a
list containing the same numbers (but not the same ListItem objects)
as the original list.
<p>

</p></li><li>A <b>recursive</b> method <code>reverseRecurse</code> that takes no
parameters and returns a ListItem.  The return value should be
a <b>new</b> list structure that contains the same numbers as this list, but
in the reverse order.  (Hint: Use a helper procedure with an extra
parameter that accumulates the reversed list.)  
<p>

</p></li><li>An <b>iterative</b> method <code>reverseLoop</code> that takes no
parameters and returns a ListItem.  The return value should be
a <b>new</b> list structure that contains the same numbers as this list, but
in the reverse order. (Hint: Create a loop variable that's a ListItem reference
to keep track of your current position in the list.)
<p>

</p></li><li>An <b>iterative</b> method <code>stretch</code> that takes a positive number <code>n</code>
as a parameter and returns a new ListItem beginning a
list in which each of the numbers in the original
list is repeated <code>n</code>
times.  For example, if the original
list is ( 6 7 6 9 ) and the parameter value is
2, then the new list returned is ( 6 6 7 7 6 6 9 9 ).
<p>

</p></li><li>A method <code>find</code> that takes an integer <code>target</code>
and returns the first ListItem in the list that contains the given number.
If the target does not occur in the list, then <code>null</code> is returned.
<p>
<!--
<LI>A method <CODE>max</CODE> that
returns the largest number in the list.
Initialization must be done carefully.
Hint: You know that the maximum
value must be at least as large as the number in the first ListItem.
-->
</p></li></ol>
<p>

</p></li><li>In the file <b>Lab6.java</b>, write procedures
that satisfy the following specifications.  <b>Test each
thoroughly.</b>
In each case, be sure to use recursion or iteration as indicated.
Where not indicated, you may choose either approach.
Be sure to handle the case where the input is null.

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>A <b>recursive</b> procedure <code>evenElements</code>
<pre>PARAMETERS:   a ListItem reference, ls
RETURN VALUE: a ListItem at the beginning of a list structure
              containing copies of the even numbers in given list.
                 for example, given input list ( 3 2 6 9 ), the
                 return value would be the list ( 2 6 )
</pre>
<p>

</p></li><li>A <b>recursive</b> procedure <code>pairwiseSum</code>
<pre>PARAMETERS:   two ListItem references, ls1 an ls2
RETURN VALUE: a ListItem at the front of a new list containing the pairwise
              sum of the elements in ls1 and ls2
                 for example, given lists ( 3 2 6 ) and ( 1 4 2), 
                 the return value would be the list ( 4 6 8 )
</pre>
You may assume that the given lists are the same length.
<p>

</p></li><li>An <b>iterative</b> procedure <code>smallElements</code>
<pre>PARAMETERS:   a ListItem reference, ls
              an integer n
RETURN VALUE: a new list identical to the given list, except
              that it contains no occurrences of numbers greater than n.
              for example, given input list ( 3 2 6 3 4 ) and 3,
                 the return value would be the list ( 3 2 3 )
</pre>
<p>

</p></li><li>An <b>iterative</b> procedure <code>scale</code>
<pre>PARAMETERS:   a ListItem reference, ls
              an integer n
RETURN VALUE: none (void)
              the procedure <b>mutates</b> the list by multiplying
              each number in the list by the given number n.
                 for example, given input lists ( 3 2 6 3 4) and
                 the number 3,
                 the modified list would be ( 9 6 18 9 12 ).
</pre>

</li><li>A procedure <code>insertAfter</code>
<pre>PARAMETERS:   a ListItem reference, ls
              two integers i and j (not equal)
RETURN VALUE: none (void)
              the procedure <b>mutates</b> the list by inserting the
              given number i after each occurrence of j.
                 for example, given input lists ( 3 2 6 3 4) and
                 the number 5 and 3,
                 the modified list would be ( 3 5 2 6 3 5 4 ).
</pre>
Be sure to do this by creating new list items only for the inserted
numbers.  Modifying the <code>next</code> references in the existing
ListItem objects to insert the new items in the right places.
Don't create a whole new list structure.
<p>
</p></li></ol>

<p></p></li><li>In the <code>run</code> method in the file <b>Lab6.java</b>,
make calls to all the methods and procedures
you have written to demonstrate that they work properly.
Be sure to test them on a variety of lists.

</p><h3>What To Turn In:</h3>

<b>Part I:</b> You do not need to turn anything in for Part I, but
should work the practice problems carefully and check your answers as
preparation for the quiz.

<p>
<b>Part II:</b> Staple together the following items
by the due date:
</p><ol>
<li> a completed <a href="http://www.cse.wustl.edu/%7Ekjg/cs101/Labs/cover-sheet.html">cover sheet</a>,
</li><li> a paper printout of all of the code you have written
</li><li> a paper printout of terminal output from your test cases
</li></ol>

<p><b>Demo:</b> Bring your lab packet to a TA and demonstrate what
your program does.  The TA will ask you to modify your
program in a certain way and predict what will happen before you
run it.  Your demo grade will be based on whether or not you are
able to accurately predict what will be shown on the canvas and
what will be output to the terminal.
Be sure to complete your demo no later than your next lab section
immediately following the due date.  If you plan to do your demo
during lab section, your lab packet must be turned in to a TA
<b>within the first 15 minutes of the lab section.</b>
