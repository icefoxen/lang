Part II: Three implementations of the Mapping interface
</H3>

In this lab, you will implement a "mapping" abstract data type
three different ways.  All of the implementations will provide the
same functionality (same interface) but may differ in their
efficiency.

Think of a "mapping" ADT as a relation between a <em>domain</em>
and a <em>range</em>.  For example, a telephone directory is a mapping
from names to telephone numbers.  The domain is all possible names,
and the range is all possible phone numbers.  Each entry in the
mapping is a pair of elements, one from the domain and one from the
range.  Usually, the domain and range are different, but that is not a
requirement.  In this lab, your mapping will be from item names
(represented as String objects) to numerical values (represented as
doubles).  This kind of data structure could be useful, for example,
to map stock names to their current prices in a stock market program.
For now, though, you can just think about the mapping as a relation
between string values and numerical values.

<P> Read over the entire lab before you start.  Also, review your
lecture notes on implementing sets using ordered lists and binary
search trees.  Also, review your notes on arrays.  The on-line lecture
summaries of these topics may also help you.  <P>


<B>Implementation notes:</B>
<UL>
<LI>One purpose of this lab is for you to learn how
to design and implement the various data structures.  Therefore,
<b>do not</b> use any of the data structures that are already
provided by Java in the <tt>java.util</tt> package.  Build your data
structures from scratch.
<P>
<LI>To compare String values, use the <b>provided</b>
<code>compareTo</code> method of the String class that compares
strings  based on lexicographic ordering (dictionary ordering).
The <code>compareTo</code> method takes as its parameter another String,
and returns an integer whose value is:
<UL>
<LI>negative if this string is less than the parameter,
<LI>zero if this string is equal to the parameter, or
<LI>positive if this string is greater than the parameter.
</UL>

<P><LI>
<B>Do not use the <code>==</code> operator to compare String values for
equality.</B>
When <code>==</code> is used on objects, it evaluates to true if both
sides of the comparison refer to the same exact memory location (i.e.,
it's the exact same object).  Therefore, even if two String objects
contain the same text, the <code>==</code> test for equality on the
two objects would return <code>false</code> if they are not
the same object.
</UL>


<B>Directions:</B>
<OL>
<LI>Download <a href="lab8.zip">lab8.zip</a> 
into your cs101 folder and create an Eclipse project for it.
<P>

<LI>Open the provided file <b>Mapping.java</b> and study the provided
code in that file.  Notice that the file does not contain a class
definition, but instead contains something called an
<em>interface</em>.  An interface is just a collection of method names
with parameter types and return types.  It cannot be instantiated,
because it doesn't actually contain implementations of any of the
methods.  That is, the methods have no bodies.

<P>
<LI>Open the provided file <b>OrderedMapping.java</b> and
read the provided code.  Notice the line
<pre>
public class OrderedMapping implements Mapping
</pre>
near the top of the file.  The phrase "implements Mapping" means that
this class conforms to the Mapping interface.  In other words,
this class must define all of the methods contained in the
Mapping interface, and the compiler will check that this is indeed
the case.

<P><LI>Look at the test procedure
in the provided file <b>Lab8.java</b>.
Notice that the parameter to this procedure has type
Mapping.  This means that any object passed to this procedure must
implement the Mapping interface, and so the procedure may call any of
the methods in that interface on the object.  In this program, three
different objects will be created and passed to the test procedure.  <b>All
three are instantiations of different classes, but all three classes
implement the Mapping interface.</b>  Therefore, Java's support for
interfaces provides
the power to define the interface of an ADT and write programs in
terms of that interface.  Then, you can implement the ADT in different
ways and use them in the program, provided that you conform to the
defined interface.

<P><LI>Study again the interface definition in the file <b>Mapping.java</b>,
paying attention to the documentation for each method.
Complete the implementation in the file <b>OrderedMapping.java</b>,
being sure to satisfy the specification given in the interface file.
For your internal representation, use a
linked list, where each list item contains a domain element (a String), a range
element (a double), and a next pointer (to another list item).  If you
like, you can use dummy nodes at the beginning and end of the list.
Also, feel free to create a doubly linked list (with previous pointers) if you
find that easier.
<P>
One of the representation invariants for your OrderedMapping
implementation should be that the list is kept in alphabetically
sorted order according to the domain element.
Use the fact that the list is kept in sorted order
in order to improve the efficiency of the <code>put</code> and
<code>get</code> methods.

<P><LI>In the file <b>Lab8.java</b>, create an instance of an OrderedMapping,
and pass it to the test procedure.  Verify that the output is correct.
Look at printed values on the terminal to be sure that your list
contains the data you expect.
Verify that your list is being kept in sorted order.
<P>

<P><LI> Complete the implementation in the file <b>TreeMapping.java</b>,
being sure to satisfy the specification given in the interface file.
To do this, you'll need to define a <tt>TreeNode</tt> class.
Each node in the tree will have a domain element (a String),
a range element (a double), a
(possibly null) left subtree and
a (possibly null) right subtree.
Your implementation should satisfy the representation invariant that
for each node, all strings in the left subtree are alphabetically less,
and all strings in the right subtree are alphabetically greater.
Make use of this invariant
to improve the efficiency of the <code>put</code> and
<code>get</code> methods.
<B>As a simplification, when implementing the <tt>remove</tt> method,
just set the range value to zero.</B>  Physically removing the node
from the tree would be the correct thing to do,
but it's a bit involved, so we're leaving that as an extra credit option.
<P>
Implement the <code>toString</code> method so that it returns
a readable representation of the tree.
Display the tree sideways, with the root of
the tree at the left edge of the page.
Your return String should have one node
per line, something like this:
<pre>

                        (quack,4)
            (oink,5)
                        (moo,7)
(meow,2)
                        ()
            (bow wow,8)
                        (baa,5)

</pre>
This is called an <em> in-order traversal</em> of the tree, since
one subtree is traversed first, then the node itself, and then
the other subtree.
You can use the special
character <code>'\n'</code> in a String to cause the terminal to advance
to a new line as it prints the string.
<P>
Hint: 
The depth of the node in the tree determines how much to indent.
So, use a helper procedure with a String parameter
that keeps track of the leading spaces
for each line of output.  Start it out with the value <code>""</code>
and then concatenate a String of spaces to create
the indentation String parameter for the recursive calls on both subtrees.
If you want, you can use the special tab character <code>'\t'</code>
instead of multiple spaces.

<P><LI>
In the file <b>Lab8.java</b>, create an instance of a TreeMapping,
and pass it to the test procedure.  Verify that the output is correct.
Look at the printed values on the terminal to be sure that the
representation invariant is being preserved by your implementation.
<P>

<LI>In the file <b>ArrayMapping.java</b> complete the implementation of the
class <tt>ArrayMapping</tt> to implement the
Mapping interface.
For your internal representation, create an array of references to
<code>Pair</code> objects, where each pair contains a domain element (a String) and a range element (a double).
Create the array to allow enough space for 100 pairs.
One of your representation invariants should be that the array is kept in
sorted order according to the values of the String in each pair.
Use <b>binary search</b> on the array
as discussed in class to improve the efficiency of the
<code>get</code> method.
Note that when you insert an item that belongs somewhere in the middle
of the array, you'll have to bump all the items after it down by one to
make room for it in the array.
<P>

<LI>In the file <b>Lab8.java</b>, create an instance of an ArrayMapping,
and pass it to the test procedure.  Again, notice that the test
procedure only cares that the object's type implements the mapping
interface.  Verify that the output is correct.
Look at the printed values of the mapping to be sure that your array
is being kept in sorted order.
</OL>

<P><HR><P>

<B>Extra Credit Option: (2 points)</B>
In the implementation above, we "cheated" by letting the remove method
for binary tree deletion simply set the range value in the mapping to zero.
In a real binary tree implementation, you'd want to actually remove the
node from the tree. 
For extra credit, modify your binary tree implementation so that
when a domain element is removed, its node is taken out of the tree.
Remember that the difficult case is when the node has two children (both
left and right), in which case you'll move the right-most node of the
left subtree up to the position of the node being deleted.
Review your class notes and ask if you have any questions.
