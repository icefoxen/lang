Next to do:

Add HTML parser  --HARD.  Java ain't good for text, no built-in search-and-replace.  Maybe find someone else's Java web browser and take a look?

*Change the input method to PrintWriter or writeChars or something, or maybe have a choice.  That will prevent it from transferring binary characters.*

Add source viewer

Add picture viewer?

Add a window that lists the pictures/hyperlinks?

Make a program/method that snaffles all webpages attached to a page --recursion, baby.

Try to download a file?

Proxy support.  I know how, now.  Figure out how to define local pages.
