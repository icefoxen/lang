Just an image-viewer...  You should be able to specify an image and view it.  

Perhaps you can specify a series of images or a certain directory and flip back and forth through them, though that'll be much harder.  

Maybe have equivilant versions/modes for sounds and movies.

Simple program that shows jpg and gifs.  Need to learn more about IO and the FileChooser first, but after that it should be dead easy.

Maybe multimedia and soundplayer also?  Harder, because you need to make buttons to start/stop/pause/rewind and junk.
